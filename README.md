# SimpleBlockChain
Simple BlockChain style program written in Javascript primarily to help me learn how it works at a basic level.

The project was written in Javascript using Visual Studio Code and is based very heavily on an online tutorial. I took some liberties and added some tests and comments. The code for this project is inspired very heavily by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124&t=612s and I do not wish to take credit for the code I did not come up with myself. The only reason this program is posted on my page is merely to demonstrate that I have a basic level of knowledge of this technology and because I don't have nearly enough Javascript on here.
